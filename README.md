# hello-world
How's it everyone?

sokona87 here, just trying to get a feel for this respository stuff. 
this is my first time doing anything related to technology, this place is like a whole new world,
I love it and am scared, but I am willing to take on a new challenge even if that means falling
flat on my face while doing it.
